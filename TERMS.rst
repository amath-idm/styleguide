Data
==========
- Be very careful about including sensitive data in a repository. Highly sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information, **should not be included under any circumstances**. Other non-public data should not be included in repositories that are destined to be made public. If in doubt, leave it out. Any non-public data that gets merged into the main branch of the repository must be excised from the repository's history using e.g. `git-filter-branch`, BFG, or other similar methods.
